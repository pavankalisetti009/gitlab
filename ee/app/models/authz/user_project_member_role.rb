# frozen_string_literal: true

# This model records member role assignment to a user in projects through:
# - Project membership
# - Project sharing
#
# shared_with_group_id is nil for assigments through project membership.
#
# For assignments through project sharing project_id points to the shared project
# (project_group_link.shared_from) while shared_with_group_id ==
# project_group_link.shared_with_group_id. The shared_with_group_id column serves
# as a differentiator between different types of member role assignments as well
# as a way to easily delete records when the matching project_group_link record is
# deleted or the user's membership to shared_with_group is removed.
