        # TODO: Dynamically determining the type of a constructor arg based on the class is an antipattern,
        # but this pattern was inherited from Epics::BaseService which this service replaces (via replacing
        # its descendant Epics::UpdateService). The root cause is that the epic services hierarchy had
        # inheritance issues where inheritance may not be the appropriate pattern.
        # See more details in comments below and follow on issue to address this:
        # https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328438

      # TODO: This service replaces Epics::UpdateService (a descendant of Epics::BaseService) and inherits
      # its constructor pattern issues. The first argument is named group because epics have no `project`
      # associated, even though other similar services take a `project` as the first argument.
      # This pattern exists because named arguments were added after classes were already in use,
      # and `.constructor_container_arg` is used to determine the correct keyword.
      #
      # This reveals an existing inconsistency where sometimes a `project` is passed but ignored,
      # violating the Liskov Substitution Principle
      # (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle),
      # since we cannot determine which form of constructor to call without knowing the subclass type.
      #
      # This suggests inheritance may not be the proper relationship to "issuable",
      # because it may not be an "is a" relationship. Other `IssuableBaseService` subclasses
      # are in the context of a project and take the project as the first argument.
      #
      # There are concerns like state management and notes which are applicable to epic services,
      # but not necessarily all aspects of issuable services.
