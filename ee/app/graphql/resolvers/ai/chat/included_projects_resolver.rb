# This GraphQL query is used in Duo Chat's `/include <repository>` command
#
# This returns the projects relevant to the user, in the following order of relevance:
#   - recently contributed: projects the user contributed to within the last month (excluding public forked projects)
#   - recently visited: projects the user visited within the last month (excluding public forked projects)
#   - authorized only: projects that the user can see if logged in (excluding all public projects)
# ...up to a maximum results size of MAX_RESULTS_COUNT
#
# If the `search` parameter is given:
#   - the projects' path and name are filtered by the `search` term;
#     the project description is not included in the filter
#   - each of the list of projects by relevance category (recently contributed, recently visited, authorized only)
#     are ordered by `search` term similarity score
#
# If the `search` parameter is not given:
#   - there is no filter on the projects' path and name
#   - each of the list of projects by relevance category (recently contributed, recently visited, authorized only)
#     are ordered by recency according to the relevance category
