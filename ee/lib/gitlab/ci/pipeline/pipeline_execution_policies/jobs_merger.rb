# This class is responsible for injecting jobs from Pipeline Execution Policies into the project pipeline.
# It injects a stage into the pipeline as long as it is included in the declared stages.
#
# In `pipeline.stages`, we have positions that match the index of the declared stage.
# If a stage is not used in the project pipeline but it was declared, we have a position gap
# where we can inject the stage without creating position conflicts.
