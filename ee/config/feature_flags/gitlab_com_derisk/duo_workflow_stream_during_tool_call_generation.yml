name: duo_workflow_stream_during_tool_call_generation
description: This controls whether or not the Duo Workflow Service will keep streaming updates to the user via websocket when there is a tool call being made. This was implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/merge_requests/3459 and serves as a way of keeping the connection alive while there are long running tool calls being generated by the LLM. It does have the downside of streaming a lot of redundant data down the gRPC connection through to workhorse and then the user via websockets which may cause problems so we added a feature flag.
