# Shared context + shared examples for ES vulnerability sync specs.
#
# NOTE: For retro-compatibility, we keep *two* positive shared examples:
#
#   1. `sync vulnerabilities changes to ES` (original style)
#      - uses a `let(:expected_vulnerabilities)` defined in the spec
#      - compares captured `received_vulnerabilities` against it
#
#   2. `it syncs vulnerabilities with ES` (newer explicit-IDs style)
#      - takes a proc returning vulnerability IDs
#      - asserts `track!` was called with objects matching those IDs
#
# Both include `with ES stubs` to share the same setup.
#
# TODO: Migrate all specs to `it syncs vulnerabilities with ES`
# and remove `sync vulnerabilities changes to ES` once no longer used.
# Issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/572489
