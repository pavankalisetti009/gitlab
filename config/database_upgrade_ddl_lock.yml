# Database DDL Lock Configuration
#
# This configuration prevents DDL migrations from being merged during Postgres upgrades,
# replacing the need for hard Production Change Locks (PCL) that block all deployments.
#
# Configuration options:
#
# start_date: "2025-12-09T09:00:00Z"
#   The date when DDL migration merges will be blocked.
#   Format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ in UTC)
#
# end_date: "2025-12-09T09:00:00Z"
#   The date when the block will be lifted.
#   Format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ in UTC)
#
# details: "Contention due to Postgres 17 upgrade"
#   An explanation shown to developers when their MR is blocked. Be specific about why the lock is in place.
#
# upgrade_issue_url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/12345"
#   Link to the issue tracking the upgrade progress.
#
# warning_days: 7
#   Number of days before start_date when warnings begin appearing on MRs.
#   Gives developers advance notice to plan their work accordingly.
#
# We can plan the locks ahead, having a pre-established lock list for upcoming upgrades.
# The list of locks is ordered by start_date.
#
# Example:
#    locks:
#      - start_date: "2024-12-09T09:00:00Z"
#        end_date: "2024-12-09T09:00:00Z"
#        details: "Contention due to Postgres 16 upgrade"
#        upgrade_issue_url: ""
